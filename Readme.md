# docker-radicale-birthday

This custom image based on 
[docker-radicale](https://github.com/tomsquest/docker-radicale/) integrates a 
python [script](https://github.com/iBigQ/radicale-birthday-calendar)  (and its dependencies) to automatically generate a birthday 
calendar from the address book on radicale.
